# Background:

This repository contains the frontend of the openpaths project. The openpaths project seeks to create software that support the following strategic goals:


1. Make it easier for Public Transport  Authorities (PTO's) to create, validate and visualize data related to the within station pedestrian navigation
2. Make it easier to PTO's to assess the level of accessibility for mobility restricted users who need to use their stations
3. Make it easier for PTO's to publish this data using open standards like GTFS and Transmodel/Netex.
4. Make it easier for open data enthusiasts to assess the quality of accessibility for train stations using open data
5. Incorporate data on indoor navigation while creating itineraries for mobilty restricted users with OpenTripPlanner
6. Incorporate real time information about elevator outtages while creating itineraries

### Status
